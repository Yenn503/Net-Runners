Net-Runner is a final-year university project and research prototype for red-team assessments with language-model support. It builds on the public [OpenClaude](https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude) fork and turns that base into a workflow-driven assessment framework with specialist agents, evidence capture, and project-scoped runtime state.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
> Use this framework only on targets you are explicitly authorized to test. Net-Runner is for legal security testing, lab work, and research use.

## 🔍 How It Works

Give Net-Runner a target and goal in plain language. It creates a project-scoped `.netrunner/` runtime, selects the right workflow, pulls relevant context back in, and captures evidence throughout the assessment.

- Keeps workflow state, evidence, findings, artifacts, and reports in one runtime
- Pulls useful context back in through relevant-memory recall, project memory, agent memory, session summaries, and background memory consolidation
- Can run in its normal direct-tool path or in optional coordinator mode, where the coordinator delegates tool work to workers
- Uses specialist agents when a task has a clear boundary
- Applies guardrails before higher-risk or out-of-scope actions
- Runs locally by default and keeps optional remote-session support from the upstream base
- Keeps shared team memory available as an optional per-repo sync path when OAuth and a GitHub-backed repo are available
- Supports web, API, mobile, lab, Active Directory, WiFi, and CTF work

---

## 🧠 Core Engine Features

- **Retrieval-backed context** — relevant-memory recall, agent memory, session summaries, and background consolidation keep useful context available across longer assessments
- **Evidence-first workflow** — findings, artifacts, notes, and reports stay tied to the same `.netrunner/` engagement
- **Optional coordinator mode** — when `NETRUNNER_COORDINATOR_MODE=1` is set, the coordinator handles routing and workers handle delegated tool use
- **Shared team memory** — local memory stays on by default, and shared team memory can sync per repo when OAuth and GitHub remote support are available
- **Guardrail enforcement** — bash, fetch, and delegated actions all run through engagement-aware guardrails
- **Skills-first execution** — assessment method lives in reusable skills and runtime structure, while MCP stays for the integrations that actually need it
- **Remote and local modes** — local execution is the default path, but the engine still keeps optional remote-session support from the upstream base

## 🚀 Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>Open setup and first run</strong></summary>

### 1. Install and build

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

### 2. Configure model provider

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
node dist/cli.mjs
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY`

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY`

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-pro"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Ollama

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="llama3.1:8b"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Any OpenAI-compatible API

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-provider.com/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="your-model-name"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

### 3. Run an assessment

```text
Assess https://target.example. Start with recon, map the attack surface, validate findings, and capture evidence.
```

### 4. Optional coordinator mode

```bash
export NETRUNNER_COORDINATOR_MODE=1
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Use this when you want the main runtime to stay in a coordinator role and push bounded tool work to workers.

## ⚙️ Execution Flow

1. Net-Runner detects assessment intent and target type
2. Initializes `.netrunner/engagement.json` and run-state for the project
3. Injects workflow, scope, impact, skills, and retrieved context from persistent memory
4. Runs directly with shell, file, web, and code tooling, or uses coordinator mode to delegate bounded tool work to workers
5. Applies engagement guardrails before higher-risk or out-of-scope actions
6. Records evidence, findings, artifacts, and reports in the project runtime

## 🎯 Workflows

- `web-app-testing` — route mapping, auth testing, and vulnerability validation
- `api-testing` — endpoint discovery, schema checks, auth/state testing
- `mobile-app-testing` — Android app analysis with `adb`, `apktool`, `jadx`, `frida`, `objection`, `MobSF`, `drozer`, `apkleaks`
- `lab-target-testing` — host/service enumeration, privilege escalation, lateral movement
- `ctf-mode` — challenge-focused runs with rapid iteration
- `ad-testing` — Active Directory, Kerberos, trust paths, AD CS
- `wifi-testing` — wireless assessments, handshake capture, rogue AP testing, 802.11 analysis

The recon stack includes cloud and identity enumeration tools: `cloud_enum`, `GHunt`, `holehe`, `haklistgen`.

## 📁 Runtime Layout

```

`.netrunner/` is the project runtime for the current assessment. Persistent memory, session summaries, and shared team memory live under the Net-Runner config directory. Shared team memory sync is optional and requires OAuth plus a GitHub-backed repo.
