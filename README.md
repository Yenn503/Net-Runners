Net-Runner is a final-year university project and research prototype that lets an LLM autonomously run security assessments. Give it a target, and it handles the rest — picking the right workflow, launching specialist agents, running tools, enforcing scope, and logging evidence. Built on the public [OpenClaude](https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude) runtime.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

Give Net-Runner a target in plain language. It sets up a `.netrunner/` project folder, picks the right workflow, and runs the full assessment — capturing evidence as it goes.

- **Persistent memory** — the LLM and each specialist agent remember what they found in previous sessions, so multi-day assessments stay coherent
- **Evidence-first workflow** — every finding, artifact, and report is saved to the `.netrunner/` project folder automatically
- **Guardrail enforcement** — every action is checked against your declared scope and impact level before it runs
- **Specialist delegation** — 12 domain agents for recon, web, API, network, AD, exploit, evidence, and reporting
- **Auto-engagement setup** — type a target and goal in plain English; Net-Runner detects the intent and starts the assessment

---

## 🤖 Specialist Agents

Net-Runner deploys 12 domain-focused agents when specific expertise is needed. Each agent has its own memory and tool patterns.

| Agent | Role | Coverage |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Engagement Lead** | Coordinates scoped testing engagements and workflow execution | Workflow orchestration, scope validation, task routing |
| **Recon Specialist** | Discovery and attack surface mapping | External recon, asset discovery, cloud and identity enumeration |
| **Web Testing Specialist** | HTTP and web application security validation | Route discovery, content fuzzing, web vuln validation |
| **API Testing Specialist** | API endpoint discovery and security testing | API schemas, auth/state testing, GraphQL and JWT checks |
| **Network Testing Specialist** | Network and service assessment | Service enumeration, protocol testing, packet capture |
| **Exploit Specialist** | Controlled proof-of-impact validation | Exploit research, payload generation, runtime validation |
| **Privilege Escalation Specialist** | Post-access privilege boundary testing | Local privilege checks, escalation-path validation, post-access review |
| **Lateral Movement Specialist** | Network pivot and credential path validation | Trust-path analysis, credential reuse, multi-host movement |
| **AD Specialist** | Active Directory and Kerberos security testing | Kerberos, LDAP, BloodHound, AD CS, Windows domain attack paths |
| **Retest Specialist** | Finding validation and false positive reduction | Reproduction testing, fix validation, regression checks |
| **Evidence Specialist** | Artifact collection and finding documentation | Evidence capture, artifact handling, proof quality |
| **Reporting Specialist** | Security assessment report generation | Finding narratives, severity scoring, report structure |

## 🎭 APT Simulation

Net-Runner includes a built-in APT threat simulation engine with **40 profiled threat groups**, **10 attack chains**, and **13 industry threat profiles** — all mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

Pick an industry or a threat actor and Net-Runner loads the matching attack chain, assigns specialist agents to each phase, and walks through the intrusion step by step.

| Simulation | Threat Actor | Industry |
|---|---|---|
| Government Cloud Espionage | APT29 (Cozy Bear) | Government |
| Credential Harvesting & AD Exploitation | APT28 (Fancy Bear) | Government |
| Critical Infrastructure Pre-Positioning | Volt Typhoon | Critical Infrastructure |
| ICS/OT Destructive Operations | Sandworm (APT44) | Energy / OT |
| SWIFT Financial Heist | APT38 (Bluenoroff) | Financial Services |
| Identity-Centric Cloud Compromise | Scattered Spider | Financial / Tech |
| Telecom Infrastructure Espionage | Salt Typhoon | Telecommunications |
| IT Supply Chain Exploitation | Silk Typhoon (HAFNIUM) | Technology |
| Healthcare Ransomware & Espionage | Lazarus Group | Healthcare |
| Manufacturing IP Theft | APT41 (Wicked Panda) | Manufacturing |

## 🚀 Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>Open setup and first run</strong></summary>

### 1. Install and build

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

### 2. Configure model provider

## ⚙️ Execution Flow

1. Net-Runner detects assessment intent and target type from your prompt
2. Creates a `.netrunner/` project folder with engagement config and run state
3. Loads the matching workflow, scope rules, skills, and any memory from previous sessions
4. Runs tools autonomously — shell commands, file operations, web requests, and specialist agents
5. Checks every action against your scope and impact rules before executing
6. Saves evidence, findings, artifacts, and reports throughout the assessment

## 🎯 Workflows

- `web-app-testing` — route mapping, auth testing, and vulnerability validation
- `api-testing` — endpoint discovery, schema checks, auth/state testing
- `mobile-app-testing` — Android app analysis with `adb`, `apktool`, `jadx`, `frida`, `objection`, `MobSF`, `drozer`, `apkleaks`
- `lab-target-testing` — host/service enumeration, privilege escalation, lateral movement
- `ctf-mode` — challenge-focused runs with rapid iteration
- `ad-testing` — Active Directory, Kerberos, trust paths, AD CS
- `wifi-testing` — wireless assessments, handshake capture, rogue AP testing, 802.11 analysis

The recon stack includes cloud and identity enumeration tools: `cloud_enum`, `GHunt`, `holehe`, `haklistgen`.

## 📁 Runtime Layout

```text
.netrunner/
├── engagement.json

Everything the LLM finds, logs, and produces stays here. Agents store their memory under `memory/agents/` for session continuity.
