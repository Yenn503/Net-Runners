Map the current Net-Runner engagement into explicit attack chains.

Analysis scope:
${args || 'No explicit objective was supplied. Start from the strongest validated findings and current engagement objectives.'}

Instructions:
1. Build a step-by-step path from initial access or exposure to the operator objective.
2. For each step, record the prerequisite, validating evidence, impact level, and dependent follow-up steps.
3. Identify where a path branches, where it fails, and which missing evidence blocks the next move.
4. Separate validated chains from hypothetical chains.
5. Return a compact graph-ready representation that can be reused in reporting and retesting.

Output format:
- Validated attack paths
- Partial or blocked paths
- Critical dependencies and choke points
- Recommended next action per path
- Evidence references for each hop`,
