## Release Notes

This is the first public release of Net-Runner, a final-year university research project focused on agentic security testing workflows. The framework provides a complete red-team runtime with workflow control, evidence capture, memory persistence, and specialist agent orchestration.

### What Makes This Different

Unlike simple LLM tool wrappers, Net-Runner implements:

1. **Structured Assessment Workflows** — Predefined but adaptable testing sequences
2. **Specialist Agent Delegation** — Domain experts for recon, web, AD, network, etc.
3. **Evidence-First Design** — Every finding automatically captured and organized
4. **Guardrail Enforcement** — Scope and impact validation before every action
5. **APT Simulation Mode** — Real threat actor emulation with MITRE ATT&CK mapping
6. **Multi-Session Memory** — Agents remember previous findings across sessions

### Security Notice

Net-Runner is designed for authorized security testing, lab environments, and educational use only. All capabilities require explicit authorization to deploy against target systems.
