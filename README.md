Net-Runner is a **final-year university project** and research prototype — an **AI security testing framework** for **autonomous penetration testing**. An LLM runs the full security assessment — picking workflows, launching specialist agents, running 153+ red-team tools, enforcing guardrails, and logging evidence. Built on the public [OpenClaude](https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude) runtime.

The architecture follows the [Code Execution with MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp) pattern from Anthropic — instead of exposing 153 tools as individual MCP definitions (which would consume ~150K+ tokens of context), Net-Runner presents a minimal MCP surface (~10 core tools) and delegates all tool execution to code. Skills, agents, and workflows are discovered through the filesystem on demand. Any MCP-compatible LLM — GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, Cursor — can connect and drive the full harness without configuring API keys in Net-Runner itself. The result is a **skills-first, code-execution-first** framework where MCP calls are essential-only and the real work happens through shell execution, specialist agents, and reusable skill bundles.

## 🔍 What It Does

Give Net-Runner a target in plain language. It sets up a `.netrunner/` project folder, picks the right workflow, and runs the full assessment — capturing evidence as it goes.

- **Persistent memory** — the LLM and each specialist agent remember what they found in previous sessions, so multi-day assessments stay coherent
- **Evidence-first workflow** — every finding, artifact, and report is saved to the `.netrunner/` project folder automatically
- **Guardrail enforcement** — every action is checked against your declared scope and impact level before it runs
- **Specialist delegation** — 12 domain agents for recon, web, API, network, AD, exploit, evidence, and reporting
- **Auto-engagement setup** — type a target and goal in plain English; Net-Runner detects the intent and starts the assessment

---

## 🤖 Specialist Agents

Net-Runner deploys 12 domain-focused agents when specific expertise is needed. Each agent has its own memory and tool patterns.

| Agent | Role | Coverage |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Engagement Lead** | Coordinates scoped testing engagements and workflow execution | Workflow orchestration, scope validation, task routing |
| **Recon Specialist** | Discovery and attack surface mapping | External recon, asset discovery, cloud and identity enumeration |
| **Web Testing Specialist** | HTTP and web application security validation | Route discovery, content fuzzing, web vuln validation |
| **API Testing Specialist** | API endpoint discovery and security testing | API schemas, auth/state testing, GraphQL and JWT checks |
| **Network Testing Specialist** | Network and service assessment | Service enumeration, protocol testing, packet capture |
| **Exploit Specialist** | Controlled proof-of-impact validation | Exploit research, payload generation, runtime validation |
| **Privilege Escalation Specialist** | Post-access privilege boundary testing | Local privilege checks, escalation-path validation, post-access review |
| **Lateral Movement Specialist** | Network pivot and credential path validation | Trust-path analysis, credential reuse, multi-host movement |
| **AD Specialist** | Active Directory and Kerberos security testing | Kerberos, LDAP, BloodHound, AD CS, Windows domain attack paths |
| **Retest Specialist** | Finding validation and false positive reduction | Reproduction testing, fix validation, regression checks |
| **Evidence Specialist** | Artifact collection and finding documentation | Evidence capture, artifact handling, proof quality |
| **Reporting Specialist** | Security assessment report generation | Finding narratives, severity scoring, report structure |

## 🎭 APT Simulation

Net-Runner includes a built-in APT threat simulation engine with **40 profiled threat groups**, **10 attack chains**, and **13 industry threat profiles** — all mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

Pick an industry or a threat actor and Net-Runner loads the matching attack chain, assigns specialist agents to each phase, and walks through the intrusion step by step.

| Simulation | Threat Actor | Industry |
|---|---|---|
| Government Cloud Espionage | APT29 (Cozy Bear) | Government |
| Credential Harvesting & AD Exploitation | APT28 (Fancy Bear) | Government |
| Critical Infrastructure Pre-Positioning | Volt Typhoon | Critical Infrastructure |
| ICS/OT Destructive Operations | Sandworm (APT44) | Energy / OT |
| SWIFT Financial Heist | APT38 (Bluenoroff) | Financial Services |
| Identity-Centric Cloud Compromise | Scattered Spider | Financial / Tech |
| Telecom Infrastructure Espionage | Salt Typhoon | Telecommunications |
| IT Supply Chain Exploitation | Silk Typhoon (HAFNIUM) | Technology |
| Healthcare Ransomware & Espionage | Lazarus Group | Healthcare |
| Manufacturing IP Theft | APT41 (Wicked Panda) | Manufacturing |

## 🧠 Intelligence Engine

Six modules that give the LLM runtime adaptive decision-making, formal verification, and automated bypass capabilities during live engagements.

| Module | Skill | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Feedback Loop Engine** | `/feedback-loop` | Classifies failures (WAF, rate-limit, auth, timeout), mutates payloads, and produces adaptive retry plans with strategy tracking |
| **Statistical Verifier** | `/statistical-verification` | Confirms blind injection with Welch's t-test — baseline vs payload response comparison with p-value and confidence intervals |
| **WAF Detection & Bypass** | `/waf-detection` | Fingerprints 10+ WAFs from HTTP responses and maps each to ranked bypass techniques |
| **MCTS Attack Planner** | `/mcts-planning` | Monte Carlo Tree Search over the attack state — ranks next actions and assigns specialist agents |
| **Knowledge Graph** | — | In-memory entity/relation graph tracking hosts, services, vulns, and credentials with BFS path-finding |
| **OOB Verification** | `/oob-verification` | Generates callback payloads for blind vulns (XXE, SSRF, RCE, SQLi, Log4Shell) and tracks confirmation status |

These modules operate at two levels:

- **Skill layer** — the engagement lead invokes skills like `/feedback-loop` or `/waf-detection` when the context calls for it
- **Runtime middleware** — tool failures, WAF detection, and evidence ingestion happen **automatically** during execution. The middleware classifies failures, fingerprints WAFs on first HTTP contact, syncs findings into the knowledge graph, and persists intelligence state to `.netrunner/intelligence-state.json` for session continuity

## ⚙️ Execution Flow

1. Net-Runner detects assessment intent and target type from your prompt
2. Creates a `.netrunner/` project folder with engagement config and run state
3. Loads the matching workflow, scope rules, skills, and any memory from previous sessions
4. Runs tools autonomously — shell commands, file operations, web requests, and specialist agents
5. Checks every action against your scope and impact rules before executing
6. Saves evidence, findings, artifacts, and reports throughout the assessment

## 📁 Runtime Layout

```text
.netrunner/
├── engagement.json
├── run-state.json

│   └── ledger.jsonl
├── findings/
├── reports/
├── artifacts/
├── memory/

```

Everything the LLM finds, logs, and produces stays here. Agents store their memory under `memory/agents/` for session continuity.

## � MCP Integration

Net-Runner works in two directions over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/):

### External LLM → Net-Runner (inbound)

Connect any MCP-compatible LLM — **GitHub Copilot**, **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf** — and it can drive the full harness: 153 tools, 12 specialist agents, evidence capture, guardrails, and the intelligence engine.

**VS Code Copilot** — create `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "net-runner": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/net-runner-release/dist/cli.mjs", "mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "net-runner": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/net-runner-release/dist/cli.mjs", "mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

You talk to the LLM through **its own interface** (Copilot Chat, Claude Desktop, Cursor AI panel). The LLM calls Net-Runner tools transparently — you stay in your IDE the whole time.

### Net-Runner → External MCP Servers (outbound)

Net-Runner can also connect to external MCP servers for additional tools. Add them via `.mcp.json` or the CLI:

```bash
net-runner mcp add my-scanner -- node path/to/scanner-server.js
net-runner mcp list
```

### Both directions simultaneously

You can run Net-Runner in CLI mode with its own LLM **and** expose it as an MCP server for another LLM at the same time. These are separate processes.
