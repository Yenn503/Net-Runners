Net-Runner is a final-year university project and research prototype that lets an LLM autonomously run security assessments. Give it a target, and it handles the rest — picking the right workflow, launching specialist agents, running tools, enforcing scope, and logging evidence. Built on the public [OpenClaude](https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude) runtime.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
> Use this framework only on targets you are explicitly authorized to test. Net-Runner is for legal security testing, lab work, and research use.

## 🔍 How It Works

Give Net-Runner a target and goal in plain language. It sets up a `.netrunner/` project folder, picks the right workflow, and runs the full assessment autonomously — capturing evidence as it goes.

- Stores all evidence, findings, artifacts, and reports in one project folder
- The LLM and each specialist agent remember what they found before, so multi-session assessments stay on track
- Picks from 153 red-team tools and delegates to 12 specialist agents when domain expertise is needed
- Blocks or flags any action that goes out of scope or exceeds the allowed impact level
- Supports web, API, mobile, lab, Active Directory, WiFi, and CTF assessments

---

## 🧠 Core Engine Features

- **Persistent memory** — the LLM and each specialist agent remember what they found in previous sessions, so multi-day assessments stay coherent and every agent picks up where it left off
- **Evidence-first workflow** — every finding, artifact, and report is saved to the `.netrunner/` project folder automatically
- **Guardrail enforcement** — every action is checked against your declared scope and impact level before it runs
- **Skills-first execution** — reusable pentest playbooks (recon, exploit validation, reporting, etc.) that the LLM can trigger on demand
- **12 specialist agents** — each agent focuses on a specific domain (recon, web, network, AD, etc.) and is deployed when its expertise is needed
- **Auto-engagement setup** — type a target and goal in plain English; Net-Runner detects the intent, picks the workflow, and starts the assessment

## 🚀 Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>Open setup and first run</strong></summary>

### 1. Install and build

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

### 2. Configure model provider

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
node dist/cli.mjs
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY`

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY`

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-pro"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Ollama

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="llama3.1:8b"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

Any OpenAI-compatible API

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-provider.com/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="your-model-name"
node dist/cli.mjs
```

### 3. Run an assessment

```text
Assess https://target.example. Start with recon, map the attack surface, validate findings, and capture evidence.
```

### 4. Coordinator mode (experimental)

```bash
export NETRUNNER_COORDINATOR_MODE=1
node dist/cli.mjs
```

In this mode, the main LLM acts as a coordinator and delegates tool work to separate worker agents.

## ⚙️ Execution Flow

1. Net-Runner detects assessment intent and target type from your prompt
2. Creates a `.netrunner/` project folder with engagement config and run state
3. Loads the matching workflow, scope rules, skills, and any memory from previous sessions
4. Runs tools autonomously — shell commands, file operations, web requests, and specialist agents
5. Checks every action against your scope and impact rules before executing
6. Saves evidence, findings, artifacts, and reports throughout the assessment

---

## 🎯 Workflows

- `web-app-testing` — route mapping, auth testing, and vulnerability validation
- `api-testing` — endpoint discovery, schema checks, auth/state testing
- `mobile-app-testing` — Android app analysis with `adb`, `apktool`, `jadx`, `frida`, `objection`, `MobSF`, `drozer`, `apkleaks`
- `lab-target-testing` — host/service enumeration, privilege escalation, lateral movement
- `ctf-mode` — challenge-focused runs with rapid iteration
- `ad-testing` — Active Directory, Kerberos, trust paths, AD CS
- `wifi-testing` — wireless assessments, handshake capture, rogue AP testing, 802.11 analysis

The recon stack includes cloud and identity enumeration tools: `cloud_enum`, `GHunt`, `holehe`, `haklistgen`.

## 🤖 Specialist Agents

| Agent | Role | Coverage |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Engagement Lead** | Coordinates scoped testing engagements and workflow execution | Workflow orchestration, scope validation, task routing |
| **Recon Specialist** | Discovery and attack surface mapping | External recon, asset discovery, cloud and identity enumeration |
| **Web Testing Specialist** | HTTP and web application security validation | Route discovery, content fuzzing, web vuln validation |

| **Network Testing Specialist** | Network and service assessment | Service enumeration, protocol testing, packet capture |
| **Exploit Specialist** | Controlled proof-of-impact validation | Exploit research, payload generation, runtime validation |
| **Privilege Escalation Specialist** | Post-access privilege boundary testing | Local privilege checks, escalation-path validation, post-access review |
| **Lateral Movement Specialist** | Network pivot and credential path validation | Trust-path analysis, credential reuse, multi-host movement |
| **AD Specialist** | Active Directory and Kerberos security testing | Kerberos, LDAP, BloodHound, AD CS, Windows domain attack paths |
| **Retest Specialist** | Finding validation and false positive reduction | Reproduction testing, fix validation, regression checks |
| **Evidence Specialist** | Artifact collection and finding documentation | Evidence capture, artifact handling, proof quality |

## 📁 Runtime Layout

```text
.netrunner/
├── engagement.json
├── run-state.json
├── evidence/
│   └── ledger.jsonl
├── findings/
├── reports/
├── artifacts/
├── memory/
│   ├── private.md
│   └── agents/
└── instructions/
```

`.netrunner/` is the project folder for the current assessment. Everything the LLM finds, logs, and produces stays here. Each specialist agent also stores its own memory under `memory/agents/`, so it remembers what it found when it runs again in a future session.
